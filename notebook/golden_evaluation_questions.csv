Can high-dimensional systems be accurately simulated using a combination of low-order finite elements and finite difference methods?,"intractable due to the high dimensionality of the true system. For example, such a situation

6. It is possible to discretize the in2out and the in2sol operators on each element K by numerical
approaches other than the HDG local solvers. Examples include low-order finite element
methods (macro-element) and finite difference methods. In this case, each element K is more
like a small domain instead of an element in the traditional sense.
In the case of macro-element, each macro-element K is discretized by several low-order ele-

What is the relationship between the generalized eigenvalue problem Σbe = λΣwe and the maximization of the ratio eTΣbesubject to eTΣwe= 1?,"182 CHAPTER 8. MODELS FOR LINEAR CLASSIFICATION
8.2.3 Fisher’s LDA
This characterization leads to the discriminative interpretation of LDA, also called
Fisher’s LDA. Indeed, the generalized eigenvalue problem Σbe = λΣwe is directly
related to the maximization of the ratio eTΣbesubject to eTΣwe= 1, which provides
directions that have a large between-class variance for within class variance equal to
1. More precisely,e1 is the direction that achieves the maximum;e2 is the second best
direction, constrained to being perpendicular to e1, and so on until er which is the
optimal constrained to be perpendicular to ( e1,...,e r−1). We are therefore looking
for directions that have the largest ratio of between-class variance to within-class
variance.

Is a triangulated graph with no achordal loops decomposable?,"14.6. BUILDING JUNCTION TREES 359
Given Φ0, our goal is to design a junction-tree extension which is as feasible
as possible. So, we are not interested by the trivial extension G = (V,∅), since the
resulting junction-tree algorithm is unfeasible as soon as V is large. Theorem 14.24
in the next section will be the first step in the design of an algorithm that computes
junction trees on a given graph.

G. One says that this path has a chord at sj, with j∈{2,...,n }, if sj−1 ∼sj+1, and we will
refer to (sj−1,sj,sj+1) as a chordal triangle. A path in Gis achordal if it has no chord.
One says that Gis triangulated (or chordal) if it has no achordal loop.
Definition 14.21 The graph Gis decomposable if it satisfies the following recursive con-
dition: it is either complete, or there exists disjoint subsets (A,B,C) of V such that

What are the predicted runtimes for the five selected convolutional layers in the Eyeriss chip compared to the published times?,"spatial architectures to process the inference phase of DNNs

Eyeriss [23] is a typical spatial architecture that is designed

has a 108 KB on-chip global buffer (SRAM) and 168 PEs.
Each PE has 512 bytes of registers. It utilizes a 16 bit data
format, as this is enough for the inference phases of the deep
networks considered.
We validated our model with the Eyeriss, as properties for
the hardware have been published for this accelerator. We
selected the ﬁve convolutional layers listed in their paper for
inference (Eyeriss does not do training). Fig. 15a compares
our TRIM predicted runtimes to the times listed in [9].
Although we overestimate the performance of Eyeriss, the
most signiﬁcant difference is for CONV1, with an error of
about 17%. Fig. 15b shows that the power is underestimated
by about 20%, which was also the case with our FPGA power

means that, outside of a suﬃciently large ball, the Voronoi diagram of V is the same as that of W,

in the ratio of eigenvalues of Q, and it can easily be shown that counter-examples exist in cases

How do device drivers execute I/O instructions in Kernel Space while avoiding the issues of User Space being swappable?,"interface (API) that defines the services the driver is 
expected to support.  
The device driver paradigm takes on additional significance 
in a protected mode environment such as Linux. There are 
two reasons for this. First, User Space application code is 
normally not allowed to execute I/O instructions. This can 
only be done in Kernel Space at Privilege Level 0. So a set of 
device driver function s linked directly to the application 
simply would not work. The driver must execute in Kernel 
Space.  
Actually, there are some loops we can jump through to 
allow I/O access from User Space but it is better to avoid 
them. The second problem is that User Spa ce is swappable. 
This means that while an I/O operation is in process, the 
user’s data buffer could get swapped out to disk. And when 
that page gets swapped back in, it will very likely be at a 
different physical address.  
So data to be transferred to or f rom a peripheral device","{'producer': 'Microsoft® Office Word 2007', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Office Word 2007', 'creationdate': 'D:20131206091100', 'moddate': 'D:20131206091100', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.1810v1_File_System_-_A_Component_of_Operating_System', 'total_pages': 5, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}"

The standard theory of quantum groups can not be used for quan tizing
this couple, as expected. Speciﬁcally, let Gq = GLq(Cn) be the standard
quantum group associated with G. In a similar fashion, one can associate
[Dri, Ji, RTF] a standard quantum group Hq with H. Then, Hq cannot be
embedded as a quantum subgroup of Gq (where the notion of subgroup in
the quantum setting is akin to the usual notion of a subgroup) . Hence the
goal is to associate a quantization ˆGq with Gakin to the standard quantum
group Gq so that the standard quantum group Hq is a quantum subgroup
of ˆGq. In that case:

these probabilities in practice. In our opinion, while the shape features (closed contours) and region features 
(irregular patches) are more representative of the class (the object's 3-dimensional or 2-dimensional model), the 
edge fragments and local features are more representative of the images [ 2, 47]. Thus, while shape and region 
features are widely used for segmentation and recognition, local features and edge fragments have been used 
more often for object detection [ 18, 19, 21, 47, 85]. Considering this argument, though most methods that use 
multiple feature types choose these feature types randomly, we recommend to choose a combination of two 
feature types where one feature is robust for characterizing the image, while the other is good in characterizing 
the class. In this regard, combining edge fragments and region features is the combination that is easiest to 
handle practically.

What skills are necessary for an FP novice to effectively design a complex system using languages like Haskell or Rust?,"stems from an impoverished implementation language like

patterns to the point of triviality. Gibbons [2006] showed that
the use of a Haskell-esque type system enables patterns to be
directly represented as well-typed library-level abstractions.
From this perspective, one could argue that the Haskell or
Rust standard libraries are design pattern catalogues per se ,
just communicated via code rather than prose.
However, it is undoubtedly true that an FP novice cannot
simply read the Haskell or Rust language manuals and pro-
ceed to effectively design a complex system. A key skill that
bridges the gap is understanding how to systematically map
domain concepts to language features . With object-oriented

What is the effect of changing the lift threshold value on the selection of rules in the given dataset?,"it in the first place. Stronger associations are indicated by higher lift values [1]. According to Lift 
measurement, from table 6 (figure 6.) Rule 2 and 3 are the strong predictor due to their highest lift

Changing the lift value threshold is much more effective in selecting the rules; we should select 
this value based on how much stricter the rules we want. These results do not look similar because 
changing the lift threshold value effectively selects the rules.

Does the use of FSL (Fast Simplex Link) in MicroBlaze enable the simultaneous operation of the processor core and custom computation units?,"functional units (MIPS CorExtend [5]) with internal register

MOLEN [7] is a relevant approach that extends a basic
architecture (PowerPC) with new instructions to interfaceand
conﬁgure a number of loosely-coupled custom computation
units. While MOLEN permits the simultaneous operation of
the processor core and these units, it is not usable for optimiz-
ing ﬁne-grain program regions. For the speciﬁc coprocessor
paradigm used, the control/data communication overhead often
prohibits the implementation of useful extensions for irregular
code.
Similarly to MOLEN, the Xilinx MicroBlaze vendor-
speciﬁc core follows the coprocessor paradigm by using a
communication interface named FSL (Fast Simplex Link)
[8]. Microblaze uses special “put” and “get” instructions to
exchange control and data over a FIFO interface among the
processor core and the extension units. Again, for establishing

"Can word embeddings ensure that similar words have close numerical representations, and if not, what are the implications for the abstraction process?","This set contains all the values of x, and more, but it is easy to construct, since
we need only go through every set of synonyms Sci individually, avoiding an
exponential explosion.
The rest of the veriﬁcation process follows that of image robustness. In prac-

power of word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013). This ensures that the interval
is pretty tight. If words received arbitrary numerical representations, then our
abstraction can be arbitrarily bad.

noying thing is that for every abstract domain and every property of interest, we

whether a given English sentence contains information of th e type “somebody cooperates with some-
body else”. An algorithm for this problem should produce the answer “ N O” in case no such information
is in the input sentence and should produce “ Y ES ” and the two “somebodies” if such information is in
the sentence. Now , of course, before trying to invent such an algorithm, we will ask: What exactly do
you mean by “cooperate”? Among the English speaking communi ty , under the natural assumption of
a long experience of using English in thousands of different situations, it would be natural the start to

Does every finite multiset of k-tuples of atoms containing at least f(k) elements always contain two compatible k-tuples?,"type admit the same equalities between their coordinates.
Two tuples α = ⟨a1,...,a k⟩and β = ⟨b1,...,b k⟩we call
compatible if they have the same equality type, and for every
coordinate i∈{1,...,k }one of two conditions holds: either
(1) ai = bi; or (2) ai ̸= bi and both ai and bi do not appear
in the other tuple: ai /∈{b1,...,b k}, bi /∈{a1,...,a k}. In
particular, two equal k-tuples are always compatible.
Lemma 11. For every k∈N there is some l= f(k) ∈N such
that every ﬁnite multiset of k-tuples of atoms A: ATOMS k →
N of size at least l contains two compatible k-tuples.
Proof. Let k ∈N be ﬁxed. If A contains two equal tuples,
they are compatible. Thus we can assume A to be a set. We
take l= f(k) large enough to satisfy the constraint (9) below.
The number of different equality types Ek is ﬁnite and equal
to the number of partitions of the coordinates set {1,...,k }
(the kth Bell number). By the pigeonhole principle, for l= |A|
large enough, there is a subset A′⊆Aof size l′= |A′|= l","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-27T01:30:41+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-27T01:30:41+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020) kpathsea version 6.3.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': ""https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12018v1_Parikh's_theorem_for_infinite_alphabets"", 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}"
Is a deferrable transition in an automaton guaranteed to have the FEC property?,"(q0,G) ⊩∗
A (q,H) ⊩δ (q′,H′) and (q,H) ⊩δ (q′,H′′) where δ∈∆.3
By the discussion above, the recognition process using an automaton with the TS property
and the FEC property will never run into a dead end when applied to a valid graph. It remains
to show how the FEC property can be checked for a given automaton. We present a sufficient
condition that is easy to test. Thus, an automaton is guaranteed to have the FEC property if
it passes the test, but the converse is not necessarily true.
Consider a situation during the recognition of a valid graph when a transition has been
selected for the next move, and there are several edges one can choose from. All the edges that
are not being chosen now must be read later during the recognition process. This is only possible
for certain transitions. Let us call these transitionsdeferrable because one edge can be read now
whereas reading of the others is deferred:
A transitionδ∈∆ is calleddeferrable if and only if there are move sequences","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-03-27T00:44:55+00:00', 'author': '', 'title': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-03-27T00:44:55+00:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15052v2_Finite_Automata_for_Efficient_Graph_Recognition', 'total_pages': 23, 'page': 17, 'page_label': '151'}"

Does the performance of hybrid AI with DRL for surveillance applications depend on the fidelity to the mission of the training scenarios?,"Figure 17.

Conclusions The system proposed in this paper uses hybrid AI incorporating DRL algorithms to obtain policies that may solve the whole surveillance problem (search, tracking, collision avoidance), taking into account obstacles in the environment, while other approaches in the literature using RL tend to neglect this aspect. In the current state of development,  the performance of hybrid AI with DRL for the surveillance application seems correct, similar to that of traditional control methods in standard circumstances. This performance strongly depends on the fidelity to the mission of the training scenarios. A great effort is needed in the development of representative training situations.

Native graph stores may be further subdivided into what graph representations they use.
Graph data may be laid out in several ways, the most common ones being the AM ( adjacency

lists), and EL(edge lists). See [1, §2.4] and [4, §2.2] for a full overview of these representations.

SPARQL 1.1 5 is a declarative language (a SQL-like style), so users can focus on specification

intended for pattern (subgraph) matching rather than path traversal and it is possible to bind

Can a codeword with an average length equal to the entropy be considered optimal for data compression?,"sical information theory. In that work it was considered a

optimal. In other words, this result led to quantify the
average amount of information (absence of redundancy)

still an open problem.

We have implemented the algorithms in Java. For each of the test gra phs,
we used the well known (and quite simple and eﬀective, see e.g., [8]) Greedy
Degree heuristic to ﬁnd a tree decomposition. These tree decompositions w ere
subsequently transformed into nice tree decompositions, using th e procedure
which was previously described in Section 2. The algorithms were exec uted on
the thus obtained nice tree decompositions.
The recursions for the diﬀerent types of nodes were implemented s uch that
we spend linear time per generated entry (before removing double e ntries, and
before the reduction step). For most types, this is trivial. The com putation for
join bags contains a step, where we are given two partitions, and mu st compute
the partition that is the closure of the combination of the two (i.e., th e ﬁnest","{'producer': 'dvips + GPL Ghostscript GIT PRERELEASE 9.22', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-14T06:06:11-04:00', 'moddate': '2018-09-14T06:06:11-04:00', 'title': '', 'subject': '', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.7448v1_Speeding-up_Dynamic_Programming_with_Representativ', 'total_pages': 18, 'page': 9, 'page_label': '10'}"
Does the use of patch-wise attention in Transformer models lead to improved performance compared to preceding models?,"researchers always keep an eye on it. LogSparse Transformer
[23] and Informer [15] discover the sparsity of query-key
matching matrix and they force the elements of query to attach
to the partial elements of key for the sake of reducing the
complexity. Autoformer [24], FEDformer [25] and ETSformer
[26] combine the TSFT with seasonal-trend decomposition and
signal processing method, e.g., Fourier Analysis, in attention
mechanism to enhance their interpretability. Patch-wise atten-
tion is more popular and proven to be more useful recently.
TSFTs with patch-wise attention, including Triformer [10],
Crossformer [8] and PatchTST [16], achieve more promising
performances than preceding models. However, whichever

intended for more efficient or effective feature extraction for

such as stress or fear [39]. The speciﬁcations of each sensor
are described in Table 1.
Time Synchronization
When analyzing biometric data, it is very important to know
the exact times at which the stimuli occur, and to match them to
the corresponding bio-signals [8]. Each sensor that is included
in our system has a different sampling rate, and events that
represent the change of contents or the user’s expected reaction
always happen arbitrarily. Therefore, in this multi-modal
sensing environment, it is critical to synchronize the acquired
data according to the events. Our system has realized it well

Does the Rust compiler's automatic dependency tracking in incremental compilation mode provide sufficient granularity control to prevent excessive overhead?,"Jeff Smits, Gabriël Konat, and Eelco Visser
not been invalidated [29]. However, this incremental compiler mode is not enabled
by default (at the moment of writing) [30], since it sometimes makes compilation
slower because of the overhead of incremental computation. The difference with our
approach is that the Rust compiler automatically tracks dependencies based on reads
and writes of data structures, whereas in our approach, we explicitly state the units of
computation and dependencies between these computations. While explicitly stating
this requires more effort, the advantage is that we can tune the granularity of the
incremental compiler, to prevent the case where fine-grained dependencies cause too
much overhead.

Can machine learning classifiers improve object detection accuracy without requiring training on distorted data?,"of our methodology in improving object detection accuracy
and demonstrate its competitive performance in comparison

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the
object detection problem in complex acquisition environments
and scene contexts by leveraging image distortion classifica-
tion and improvement techniques. Our proposed methodology
includes the development of machine learning classifiers and
the use of image defilters to remove unwanted distortions and
artifacts from images. We utilized state-of-the-art de-filters to
improve the quality of the images and demonstrated that our
approach can improve the mean Average Precision without
requiring the model to be trained with distorted data, which
would increase its complexity. However, the limited availabil-
ity of de-filters for local-level distorted images represents a
limitation of our study that can be addressed in future research","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-04-15T00:28:43+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-15T00:28:43+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08293v1_Overcoming_Scene_Context_Constraints_for_Object_De', 'total_pages': 4, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}"
Can Godsil–McKay switchings be combined to form a bijection φ and ψ that satisfy the desired properties for constructing error-correcting codes?,"graphs with the same eigenvalues (so the graphs related by
Godsil–McKay switching are always cospectral). However, it
obviously changes the distances between some vertices, and
so cannot serve the purpose of constructing error-correcting
codes in a straightforward way. It is still a very interestin g
question if some bijections φ and ψ with the desired properties
(Section III-B) can be treated as a combination of Godsil–
McKay switchings, but even if they can, this would hardly
simplify the construction or its proof.

Does the inclusion of the E permission in the Escapable type allow for safe destructive updates within a let! expression?,"“escape” into the outside context. For example, the expression
let!(b) b′ = b in copy(b,b′) would violate the invariants of the
linear type system, and ruin the purely functional abstraction that
linear types allow, as both b and b′would refer to the same object,
and a destructive update to b would change the shareable b′.
We are able to use the existing kind system to handle these
safety checks with the inclusion of theE permission, for Escapable,
which indicates that the type may be safely returned from within a
let!. We ensure, via the typing rules of Fig. 6, that the left hand
side of the binding (ok in the example) has theE permission, which
excludes temporarily nonlinear references via bang(·) (see Fig. 4).
Our solution is as powerful as Odersky’s, but we encode the restric-
tions in the kind system directly, not as side-condition constraints
that recursively descend into the structure of the binding’s type.

Does the social influence model of trust relationships in social networks lead to increased product marketing and information propagation?,"Index Terms—Social Inﬂuence Model, Circuit, Inﬂuence Spread, Authority, Social Inﬂuence Maximization
✦
1 I ntroduction
Social networks make connections among individuals. Usually,
in this social paradigm, people tend to connect with their
friends, family members or colleagues, which makes the
connections in social networks are a kind of trust relationship.
Under this relationship, if somebody do something, her friends
tend to believe something is good or trustable. For example,
suppose a man bought a new product and shared his pleasant
experience about it on social network site, then his social
friends would be likely to be inﬂuenced by his experience
and may take it as an advice when they want to buy a similar
product. This is a perfect eﬀect on product marketing and
information propagating. There are two obvious reasons for
this. Firstly, the recommendation from one’s friends is more
likely to be accepted. Secondly, this eﬀect could trigger a","{'producer': 'dvips + GPL Ghostscript GIT PRERELEASE 9.22', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2021-11-27T02:55:20-05:00', 'moddate': '2021-11-27T02:55:20-05:00', 'title': '', 'subject': '', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.1105v2_A_Linear_Circuit_Model_For_Social_Influence_Analys', 'total_pages': 14, 'page': 0, 'page_label': '1'}"

Does the proposed mechanism preserve the bi-criteria welfare approximation guarantee when sellers submit their true private costs as bids?,"With Theorem 4.3, we establish a framework for converting a submodular optimization algorithm to
a mechanism satisfying IC, IR, and NAS. In such a mechanism, the sellers are incentivized to submit
their true private costs as their bids, and therefore, the mechanism preserves the bi-criteria welfare
approximation guarantee, which follows immediately from the fact that under truthful bidding the
allocations of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 coincide.
4.1 Online Mechanism Design Framework
In this section we shift our attention to the online setting, where each selleri ∈ Narrives online in an
arbitrary order and the auctioneer needs to make an irrevocable decision of whether to buy the item
or not. For convenience, assume sellerk arrives in roundk. A meta-algorithm Ao = (G) for online
submodular optimization is provided in Algorithm 3, where the scoring functionG in roundk computes
a score for a sellerk given a subsetS, a vectorc(1,k), and possibly a random seedr as input.

and bringing an innovative product or service to market, and to benefit from
economies of scale.
Start-up companies rely on external funding to support their endeavors. In
2015 alone, start-up companies have received investments of 429 billion USD in
the US and Europe alone [37, 38]. With an optimistic start-up failure rate of
75% that constitutes of 322 billion USD of capital potentially wasted on building

What is the cut-off frequency used in the high-pass filter for processing sensor feedback from the finger sensors?,"of a spoon. Once the feature is detected, which we will discuss in more detail
below, the system will proceed with the appropriate action such as grasping the
object or pushing the object. If the object is not found during the search, the

Sensor FeedbackWe use two distinct channels of information from the ﬁnger
sensors (proximity and contact) within our feedback controller. Passing the non-
linear sensor input through a high-pass ﬁlter with 20 Hz cut-oﬀ frequency [27]
allows us to detect contact, which appears as extrema in the high-pass signal.
The resulting signals are roughly equivalent to the SA-I and FA-I signals in the
human hand, that is constant pressure and dynamic tactile events, respectively
[27]. After calibrating the sensors by ﬁxing the base value of non-linear and
surface dependent sensory input moments before executing the grasp, values
ranging above and below speciﬁc thresholds are considered object and contact","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-01-24T01:11:39+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-01-24T01:11:39+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011) kpathsea version 6.0.1', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06071v1_Improving_grasp_performance_using_in-hand_proximit', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}"
Does the proposed model accurately represent the field of datacenter scheduling?,"on the global scheduler. (Continued in Figure 3: the *, @, and

R1. V alidity is the property of the proposed model to
accurately represent the ﬁeld of datacenter scheduling. Fo r
this, the model needs to cover the state-of-the-art, and in p ar-
ticular instances of datacenter scheduling from both real- world
practice and emerging concepts from the academia. Although
verifying this requirement is fundamentally a subjective task,
mapping existing schedulers to the model embodied by the
reference architecture (discussed in Section IV) and peer-
review both give evidence the model is relevant.
R2. Usefulness gives the reference architecture a real-world
purpose, which motivates its creation. As with validity, th is
property cannot be measured exactly, but the empirical resu lts
presented in Sections IV and V, combined with the future uses
of this architecture we envision in Section VIII, give evidence
of usefulness for the reference architecture.","{'producer': 'dvips + GPL Ghostscript GIT PRERELEASE 9.22', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-08-13T20:41:18-04:00', 'moddate': '2018-08-13T20:41:18-04:00', 'title': '', 'subject': '', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04224v1_A_Reference_Architecture_for_Datacenter_Scheduling', 'total_pages': 18, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}"

What is the primary factor that determines the sensitivity of the confinement potential in a quantum dot?,"biological labels.
Electrons localized in a quantum dot by a conﬁnement
potential occupy atomic like states with discrete energy levels.
Therefore, a quantum dot with conﬁned electrons is called
the artiﬁcial atom [32]. In the electrostatic or gated quantum
dots [33] [34], the conﬁnement potential results from the
external voltages, applied to the electrodes, and band offsets.
The conﬁnement potential is vary sensitive to the voltages
applied as well as the parameters of the nanostructure, in
particular, the geometry of the nanodevice and doping. The
electronic properties of the nanodevice are also determined
by the conﬁnement potential. Therefore, the knowledge of the
realistic proﬁle of this potential is important for a design of
the nanodevice with the required electronic properties and for
a theoretical description of the conﬁned electron states [35].
Also, quantum dots are being developed as labels in
medical imaging and have potential in nano-opto electronics.

Does M-DEW outperform UMA in predicting outcomes for datasets with missing data?,"that while the magnitude of improvement is lower,

5. Conclusion and Future Work
We have designed and evaluated an approach to ex-
tend the classical notion of dynamic ensemble weight-
ing to datasets with missing data. Whereas previ-
ous approaches would have required first imputing
and then training classifiers on the imputed dataset,
we develop a technique for directly optimizing at the
level of joint imputation-prediction pipelines. This
approach estimates a soft ordering of pipelines by
calculating expected relative competences of each
pipeline via the pipelines’ performances on nearby
samples from the training set. Using relative ex-
pected competence scores as weights to scale the","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2024-05-02T00:07:46+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-05-02T00:07:46+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00182v1_M-DEW:_Extending_Dynamic_Ensemble_Weighting_to_Han', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}"
Does parameter tuning improve the performance of LMFR and LaFR methods for high-resolution imaging?,"to closer align with human visual acuity at retinal resolution.
As shown in Figure 9, although parameter tuning allows
the LMFR and LaFR methods to reduce the number of
shading pixels for practical use at extremely high resolu-
tions, their lack of generalizability remains a drawback.
Furthermore, parameter tuning cannot alter the curve shape
dictated by the mapping equations, meaning that these
curves can only approximate, rather than perfectly fit, the
human visual acuity model. Lastly, the tangential shading
rate curves produced by these methods remain suboptimal.
In contrast, our approach, without any parameter tuning,
maintains a consistent shading rate aligned with human
visual acuity, enabling retinal-level detail in the foveal
region while providing satisfactory quality in peripheral
areas. Furthermore, VaFR’s radial and tangential shading
rates are identical because of our setting in Equation 6.
Further details on the tangential shading rate are discussed","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-04-01T01:00:10+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-04-01T01:00:10+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23410v1_Visual_Acuity_Consistent_Foveated_Rendering_toward', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}"

not executed on the SMs that belong to different GPUs.
Further to schedule the systems with multiple GPUs (with
different types of GPU SMs), the above constraint must be
added. Also, the lower and upper bounds of GPU segment
response time (line 4 and line 5 in Algorithm 2) must
be calculated with the corresponding computing power of
the different types of GPU SMs. After this updated GPU
federated scheduling, the ﬁxed-priority scheduling of CPU
and memory copy can be directly applied.

Can word-level edit operations effectively isolate subnetworks responsible for processing island effects in language models?,"edit operations are necessarily word-level to isolate
other factors such as sensitivity to specific syntactic
features. This makes it challenging to accommo-
date a number of morphosyntactic constructions
such as island effects (see Table 1). Instead, we use
SHVs which are particularly well-suited to probe
for subnetworks responsible for processing of mor-
phosyntactic phenomena.
Ours is certainly not the first paper to carry out
the analysis of language model skills using linguis-
tic grounding, but we believe our work is differenti-
ated by the wider coverage in terms of morphosyn-
tactic phenomena, as well as our efforts to localise
linguistic knowledge. Previous work explores the
relation between self-attention of input tokens and
dependency links (Htut et al., 2019; Clark et al.,
2019). Linzen and Baroni (2021) analyse the capa-
bilities of LSTM and GRU models on long-distance
dependencies, while Wilcox et al. (2024) use GPT-
2 and GPT-3 to look at long-distance dependencies","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-02-26T01:39:06+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-26T01:39:06+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13396v2_Linguistically_Grounded_Analysis_of_Language_Model', 'total_pages': 16, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}"
Can parallel and distributed computing effectively reduce execution time for evolutionary computation (EC) when dealing with large populations?,"population and is ther efore very time-consuming. In this case, 
parallel and distributed computing can make the evolution of 
the population or the evaluation of the objective function 
executed in parallel, and thus can save execution time. 
The second purpose is to apply EC to solve distributed 
optimization problems in distributed systems. Traditional 
optimization problems are usually centralized, that is, all 
individuals in the population share the same dataset and focus 
on the same goal to solve a global optimization problem. 
However, with the development of IoT and distributed 
computing, distributed optimization problems have emerged. 
Different from centralized optimization problems, data are 
collected by different individuals or agents in distributed 
optimization problems, and the data cannot be aggregated due 
to transmission efficiency or privacy. Thus, the individuals 
have to collaborat e to achieve global optimization.

 than  another,  it  is  certainly  less  so  to  say  one  is  worthy  of  consideration.  I  think  Metz  does

Does the update semantics model preserve the type preservation properties of Cogent's linear type system?,"written U ⊢e |µ ⇓u u |µ′ in the style of Pierce [2002]. Values in
the update semantics may now bepointers, written p, to values in a

function from a pointer to an update semantics value.
Most of the rules in Fig. 8 only di ﬀer from the value semantics

However, the key diﬀerences arise in the treatment of records and of
abstract types, which may now be represented as boxed structures,

the semantics of abstract functions ⟦·⟧u may also modify the heap.

In this paper, we propose a data integration framework where the target

their schemalessness and lack of a common declarative query language.
Concerning the schemalessness, although this provides for a form of ﬂexi-
bility in term of data modeling, this makes the generation of correspondences
between a global and local schemata more involved. Thus a ﬁrst contribution
of our work consists in generating a local schema for each integrated source

What is the expected distribution of endpoints relative to their sites when points are shot from each site independently according to a uniform distribution?,"20 DANIEL REEM
As for the upper bound regarding the time complexity for the whole d iagram, one
observes that the total number of edges is of the order of the siz e of the diagram
and recalls the well known fact that this size is O(n) (see also the proof of Lemma
13.12). Since rk is obviously bounded by the number of sites, namely by O(n) (for
each k), the bound O(n2) follows. When the sites are distributed independently of
each other and according to the uniform distribution, then with high probability all
the endpoints will be not far from their site (indeed, when a point on a ray which
is shot from the site pk is located too far from the site, then, because the sites are
distributed uniformly, there is a high probability that this point will be c loser to
other sites, and hence be located outside the cell of pk). More careful estimates show
that rk = O(ln(n/ǫ)) and the bound O(nln(n/ǫ)) follows. We believe that a better
(perhaps even linear) upper bound can be given: see Section 10.","{'producer': 'dvips + GPL Ghostscript GIT PRERELEASE 9.22', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2023-07-10T22:13:09-04:00', 'moddate': '2023-07-10T22:13:09-04:00', 'title': '', 'subject': '', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1095v5_The_projector_algorithm:_a_simple_parallel_algorit', 'total_pages': 64, 'page': 19, 'page_label': '20'}"
Can subsampling be used to improve the detection of features across an image in neural networks?,"3 Convolutional Neural Networks
3.1 Problems with image recognition
Most neural networks are unable to handle the amount of data contained in an image. For example an
image with a resolution of 3264x2448 (8 Megapixels) would result in almost 24 million inputs, as each
pixel is split into its red, green and blue parts.
Another challenge is the detection of so called ”features” across an image. Traditional neural networks
only detect a feature at a speciﬁc location in the image. This is a big issue in image recognition, as you
almost always want the entire image to be handled equally. A self-driving car should recognize a stop
sign, regardless of its position in the image.
3.2 Subsampling
Subsampling is, broadly speaking, the act of taking values from a source, observing them and combining
these into a smaller dataset that is still representative.
It’s a bit like compressing, really.

Despite the existence of such specialized software for the management of cultural
heritage data, a popular option remains the use of more general Microsoft Excel.
Jan [14] reports on the use of Excel in a case study of the investigation and man-
agement of community heritage resources. Spreadsheets were used to input details
of heritage resources, encompassing site identifiers, titles, spatial representations,
city identifiers, and descriptions. The collected metadata attempted to follow some
interoperable schemas, including CIDOC CRM.

Abstract—In this work, we present an experimental setup
and guide to enable the perching of large flapping-wing
robots. The combination of forward flight, limited payload, and
flight oscillations imposes challenging conditions for localized
perching. The described method details the different operations
that are concurrently performed within the 4 second perching
flight. We validate this experiment with a 700 g ornithopter and","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2023-09-06T03:04:16+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2023-09-06T03:04:16+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01447v1_Experimental_method_for_perching_flapping-wing_aer', 'total_pages': 2, 'page': 0, 'page_label': '1'}"
Does omitting noisy or erroneous interpretations improve the efficiency of a meta-explanation while overlooking potential noise?,"perform better when noisy or erroneous interpretations are omitted. This allows us to freely add interpretations as
seeds in our meta-explanation, considering solely the additional computational overhead as it improves efﬁciency while
overlooking potential noise.
A debate about the two truthfulness parameters, noiseand δ, took place as well, to allow users to select which values
are most appropriate for their applications. A “strong” noisewith a δvalue of 0 is recommended for a more stringent
evaluation. However, in most circumstances, “normal”noisewith a δvalue of 0.0001 would sufﬁce. In most situations,
such difference in prediction is almost minor, hence we recommend this setting. We also compared truthfulness to
the complexity metric. Based on this comparison, we wanted to highlight that our meta-explanation technique almost
always delivers both the most truthful and the least complex interpretations, especially as the δvalue increases.","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2022-12-08T01:40:14+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2022-12-08T01:40:14+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020) kpathsea version 6.3.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03513v1_Truthful_Meta-Explanations_for_Local_Interpretabil', 'total_pages': 22, 'page': 17, 'page_label': '18'}"

"Is the set L(G) commutatively regular when there exists a code W and a bijection f: M →W such that for every matrix m in M, f(m) is equivalent to πΣ(γ1 ···γh)?","Proposition 43. Let G = (N,Σ,M,S ) be an unambiguous matrix grammar of index k in normal form.
Assume that there exist a code W and a bijection f: M →W such that, for every matrix m = ( X1 →
γ1,...,X h →γh) one has f(m) ∼πΣ(γ1 ···γh). Then L(G) is commutatively regular.
Proof. Since W is a code then the map f can be extended to a monomorphism (an injective morphism)
f: M∗ →Σ∗. As one easily veriﬁes, for all α ∈M∗, one has f(α) ∼θ(α), where θ is the morphism
considered in Lemma 29. We introduce the map F: L(G) →W∗deﬁned as follows. For all v∈L(G) we set
F(v) = f(α), where α is the unique element of D(G) such that S ⇒α v.
Taking into account Lemma 29, for all v∈L(G) one has
F(v) = f(α) ∼θ(α) ∼v,
where αis chosen as above. Moreover, from Condition P1 and the injectivity off, one has that F is injective.
We conclude that the set L(G) is commutatively equivalent to F(L(G)).
Now, from the deﬁnition of F, one easily obtains F(L(G)) = f(D(G)).

Does the control contraction condition imply that the length of a differential line element decreases over time?,"where δx = ∂γ

the differential change of coordinates δz = Θ(x)δx, and we
have
˙δz = Fδz + Θ(x)w,

zFδz ≤

The control contraction condition implies that

Does merging matrices K and B into a single matrix before input reduce hardware resource costs compared to processing them separately?,"This design ensures parameters k and b behave like the conventional
output C in general matrix multiply in the DRAM, ready for the

2) Data Rearrange and Fetch: The Matrix Hadamard Product
involves three metrics: X, K, and B. However, the conventional
systolic array is equipped with only two input channels. Adding an
additional channel would result in increased hardware resource costs
and decreased hardware utilization rates. Therefore, it is imperative
to merge matrices K and B into a single matrix prior to input. In
our design, after the intermediate data addressing, the intermediate
parameters k and b are retrieved from DRAM and sent to the
memory relocation module. Here, we meticulously reorganize the
data, consolidating each element of k with its corresponding b to
form a new data stream, as shown in Fig. 6. Simultaneously, we

Does the use of multi-hop short-distance forwarding in V2I transmission save more energy than single-hop long-distance transmission?,"is considered as servers and the outage of a slot represents
a server on vacation. Under this assumption, the authors

number of hops in downlink V2I transmission may affect
the energy consumption, which however, is not the unique
factor. Even though the consumed communication energy
increases with more forwarding operations, the multi-hop
short-distance forwarding may save more energy than the
single-hop long-distance transmission. In particular, with
single-hop V2I communication, vehicles are served by the

What is the method used to redistribute the global maximum eigenvalue and matrix V among processes in a group?,"to compute them with rapid convergence is the so-called
Rayleigh quotient iteration method [21, 22].

the global maximum λ0 using a reduction with result redis-
tribution between all the processes of this group so that each
process holds the global maximum eigenvalue. Similarly, the
matrix V is formed by concatenating the local portions of
the V matrix held by the processes of the group, and the
result is redistributed between them. In practice, these oper-
ations are implemented in MPI by the collective operations
MPI_Allreduce and MPI_Allgather.
Afterwards, the normalized form of the matrix M and V

activities are guided by agile methods and tools, which aim to reduce organiza-

Is the equivalence between multi-tape machines and 1-tape machines in terms of semilinearity preserved under a specific transformation?,"can similarly define machines with multiple stores by defining the transitions to
only read and change one store at a time. Standard one-way single-tape acceptors
are a special case with only one input tape. Multi-tape inputs have been studied
for NPDA [15], NCM [21], and NPCM [23].
We will use all machine models with a one-way read-only input, including
those described in Section 1. Almost all stores we consider are formally defined in
[19], and we omit the formal definitions due to space constraints (see Appendix).
For all multi-tape machine models, they are effectively semilinear if and only
if 1-tape machines are effectively semilinear, because given a t-tape M, there is
a 1-tape machine M′ that reads a from the tape whenever it can read a from
any tape of M; hence ψ(L(M)) = ψ(L(M′)).

Does replacing ranks (8) with cardinalities of elements in nominal data coding result in an unchanged value of the correlation coefficient?,"temporarily until further research provides a satisfactory solution to the problem presented here.
5.6 Possible simpliﬁcation in nominal data coding
In subsection 2.4.1, the coding method is analogous to that used for ranking with tied ranks.
A class of identical elements whose cardinality is equal to n is assigned the rank (8). This
approach was used in the calculations described in Section 3. On the other hand, Subsection
2.5.1 noted that a linear transformation of a random variable does not change the direction of the
vector representing its random component. Thanks to this, the coding method can be simpliﬁed
for the purposes of correlation studies. In this case, it is enough to replace the ranks (8) with
cardinalities of the elements. The above change will give an unchanged value of the correlation
coefﬁcient, and at the same time slightly simplify the calculations performed during the coding
procedure for the purpose of testing the strength of the correlation relationship.

Is there a supporting hyperplane at every point on the boundary of the polytope S′?,"APPROXIMATE CONVEX HULLS 5
Proof. Let W be a point in S such that d := d(W,S′) is maximal. Let A be a
point in S′such that dist(W,A) = d (which exists by compactness). Consider the
hyperplane Hat Awith normal WA. We claim this is a supporting hyperplane at
A with respect to the polytope S′. Suppose otherwise, then there exists a point
B ∈S′ that belongs to the same side of the hyperplane as W. But then the line
AB belongs to S′and this line will intersect the ball of radius dcentered at W and
so there is a point in S′ that is closer to W then A: contradiction. The following
ﬁgure makes this clear (the circle pictured is of radius d).
On the other hand there must be some wi on or above (i.e. not on the same side
as A) the hyperplane at W with normal WA since wi are the extreme points of S.
If wi is on the hyperplane then d(wi,S′) ≥d and we are done. Otherwise, if it is
above, then since d(wi,S′) ≤dthere exists a point A0 in S′such that d(W,A0) ≤d","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-06-16T00:41:45+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-06-16T00:41:45+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01350v2_Approximate_Convex_Hulls:_sketching_the_convex_hul', 'total_pages': 16, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}"
Can the hyperplane compression algorithm effectively reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral data sampled uniformly from a simplex in high dimensions?,"the number of extreme points is small or, more generally, (ii) the data is contained

This problem occurs hyperspectral data analysis [Win99] [Win00] [Boa93].

200 points were sampled uniformly from the 2 dimensional simplex. We used the
hyperplane compression algorithm to approximate the original simplex.
Our work is motivated by an application in data reduction. The algorithm was
used to reduce the number of points in a helicopter ﬂight test of Bell Helicopter

Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought benefits, but it may also cause harm if it is not

promoted and has received a growing level of acceptance over the last a few years [1, 2]. HCAI calls for

What is the condition under which the extremal case of ororem 1 occurs?,"orem 1 is relatively easy to establish, as it is known that theextremal case (with minimal increase) occurs
when H (X |Y = y) =H (X |Y ) for ally in the support ofY [Sas12, Lem 2.2]. This is based on the so-called
“Mrs. Gerber’s Lemma"" for binary input channels [WZ73, Wit74], the analog of which is not known for
the non-binary case [JA14]. This allows us to reduce the binary version of (1) to an inequality about simple
Bernoulli random variables with no conditioning, and the inequality then follows, as the sum of twop-biased
coins is 2p(1 − p)-biased and has higher entropy (unlessp ∈ {0, 1
2 ,1}). In theq-ary case, no such simple
characterization of the extremal cases is known or seems likely [Sas12, Sec 4.1]. Nevertheless, we prove
the inequality in theq-ary setting by ﬁrst proving two inequalities for unconditioned random variables, and
then handling the conditioning explicitly based on severalcases.","{'producer': 'dvips + GPL Ghostscript GIT PRERELEASE 9.22', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-08-13T19:26:04-04:00', 'moddate': '2018-08-13T19:26:04-04:00', 'title': '', 'subject': '', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.6993v1_An_Entropy_Sumset_Inequality_and_Polynomially_Fast', 'total_pages': 33, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}"

Abstract. Hypergraph Lambek grammars (HL-grammars) is a novel
logical approach to generating graph languages based on the hypergraph
Lambek calculus. In this paper, we establish a precise relat ion between
HL-grammars and hypergraph grammars based on the double pus hout
(DPO) approach: we prove that HL-grammars generate the same class
of languages as DPO grammars with the linear restriction on l engths
of derivations. This can be viewed as a complete description of the ex-
pressive power of HL-grammars and also as an analogue of the P entus
theorem, which states that Lambek grammars generate the sam e class
of languages as context-free grammars. As a corollary, we pr ove that
HL-grammars subsume contextual hyperedge replacement gra mmars.

Does the use of AI-driven diagnostic and treatment recommendation systems in the healthcare sector compromise patient autonomy?,"social and political divides.  In the workplace, AI -driven data collection and analysis are reshaping 
employer-employee relationships. The use of AI for performance monitori ng and evaluation has led 
to concerns about worker privacy and autonomy. For instance, some companies have implemented 
AI systems that analyze employee emails, chat logs, and even facial expressions during video calls 
to assess productivity and engagement.  While these tools can provide valuable insights for 
management, they also risk creating a culture of constant surveillance that could negatively impact 
employee well-being and creativity.

What is the expression for the stochastic gradient ascent algorithm that uses the conditional expectation of the derivative of the log-likelihood of the full data given the observed data?,"∂θfU = fU∂θlogfU, we have

In other terms, the derivative of the log-likelihood of the observed data is the con-
ditional expectation of the derivative of the log-likelihood of the full data given
the observed data. When computable, this expression can be used with standard
gradient-based optimization methods, such as those described in chapter 3. This
expression is also amenable to a stochastic gradient ascent algorithm, namely

Did a four-step retraining process achieve lower error rates compared to a single training session?,"Figure 17. Performance (error) comparison of retraining process: Four-step retraining results (A, B, C, D) compared against single training results (E). The 4-step training achieved lower error rate in a quarter training time as compared to a single training session. The XOR error percentages for each training iteration was generated by calculating the average results from testing on an 11-image standard test dataset that was not included in the training dataset.  CONCLUSION  Deep convolutional neural networks, especially conditional generative adversarial networks tremendously improved the accuracy in image classification and enhancement, and object detection and segmentation. The system imitates human learning about the laws of physics through experience by learning the shape and characteristics of objects for precise segmentation and enhancement.

Does Safehaul's RL-based solution outperform benchmark schemes in terms of packet-drop rate?,"pected tail loss. Moreover, considering realistic deployments,

VIII. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we proposed the ﬁrst reliability-focused sche-
duling and path selection algorithm for IAB mmWave net-
works. Via extensive simulations, we illustrated that our RL-
based solution can cope with the network dynamics including
channel, interference, and load. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that Safehaul not only exhibits highly reliable performance
in the presence of the above-mentioned network dynamics
but also, it outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of
throughput, latency and packet-drop rate. The reliability of
Safehaul stems from the joint minimization of the average
latency and the expected value of its tail losses. The latter is
achieved by leveraging CVaR as a risk metric.","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2023-01-13T01:50:41+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2023-01-13T01:50:41+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020) kpathsea version 6.3.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03201v2_Safehaul:_Risk-Averse_Learning_for_Reliable_mmWave', 'total_pages': 10, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}"

Does the quantum capacity of a channel Φ equal its entanglement distribution capacity?,"tion of ρ∈D(X), is also large enough. This means that
using the puriﬁcation |ϕρ⟩to achieve its quantum capac-
ity becomes redundant. The property of a channel Φ is
fully characterized by its Choi state ωΦ.
The task of entanglement distribution is weaker than
the entanglement generation [11], hence QED ≤QEG.
However, it has been well established that the quantum
capacity Q is equal to entanglement generation capacity
QEG. A careful look reveals that such an equivalence
is relative to the set of entangled states as assistance
(or resource). So it is a relativized equivalence. On the
contrary, there is no such resource requirement for ED,
hence Q= QED is an exact or absolute equivalence.
The established proof of quantum coding theorem uses
Ic(πd,Φ) ≤ QEG [5]. Fortunately, its proof actually
proves Ic(πd,Φ) ≤ QED, so we can directly apply its
method to prove Q(Φ) = I(Φ).

C(X,Y) be a channel, then Q(Φ) = I(Φ).","{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2022-05-17T01:07:26+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2022-05-17T01:07:26+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020) kpathsea version 6.3.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07205v1_On_quantum_channel_capacities:_an_additive_refinem', 'total_pages': 8, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}"
Does the claim that Θn = ϑ hold true for all n ∈ N?,"Chapter 6: Deterministic GD optimization methods

We now prove(6.381) by induction onn ∈ N. For the base casen = 1 note that(6.379)

Θ1 = Θ0 − 1
α(∇L)(Θ0) = ξ − 1
α(α(ξ − ϑ)) = ξ − (ξ − ϑ) = ϑ. (6.382)
This establishes(6.381) in the base casen = 1. For the induction step observe that(6.379)

"What role does critical analysis play in enabling combatants to develop ""creative ability"" in real-time problem-solving during adversarial operations?","reference... rather than to serve as a guide. ”
In other words, critical analysis isperformative: the fact that
the analyst is performing it is as important as the conclusions they
reach, and performing it during an action is its own validation.
After all, any pre-action theoretical conclusions may be invalidated
by the adversary in the next operation. Because adversarial op-
erations are so context-dependent, rather than simply learning
rules about what to do, the combatant should learn how to solve
problems in real-time, with theory to provide a guiding “frame
of reference. ” Critical analysis gives them practice in the skills of
producing causal explanations, questioning theories when needed.
This is what Clausewitz calls “creative ability” in war.

Can heterogeneity in data be effectively addressed through the design of communication and evaluation strategies among distributed agents?,"heterogeneity of data brings great difficulty as well. It is an ideal 
case that data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). 
However, in some cases , data may be non -i.i.d. due to 
uncertainty of agent behavior and heterogeneity of devices. It is 
a great challenge to design communication and  evaluation 
strategy among distributed agents.  Even worse , some 
distributed data may be generated by malicious attackers. How 
to detect the reputation of distributed agents and preprocess 
distributed data are also worthy to be studied.  Apart from the 
above challenges, it is a potential to mine knowledge from 
massively distributed data and reuse it, leading to  studies of  
DEC for transfer optimization to solve distributed multitask 
optimization problems [164].

Does reinforcement learning exhibit characteristics of supervised learning when implemented in simulated environments?,"recognition competitive performance, as we explicitly illustrated in our MNIST Toy case above and as it was 
implicitly demonstrated by a myriad of RL experiments (e.g. Hessel et al. 2018). Hence, RL may actually be that 
missing piece of our puzzle.  
As we indicated RL however, has the strange and unique peculiarity to metamorphose its nature when embodied in 
simulated Environments, and transform, with some exceptions, into a scheme of (not less) true Supervised Learning 
character.  
This peculiarity might have been the source of our prolonged confusion. Indeed it is possible a result of this that RL 
has been usually considered in literature as a class of its own (i.e. neither Supervised nor Unsupervised) instigating 
further exploration efforts, to no avail so far. 
Why all this matters? Because if RL turns out indeed to be the Unsupervised Learning scheme which the (real)","{'producer': 'Microsoft: Print To PDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2024-09-26T14:39:19+03:00', 'author': '', 'moddate': '2024-09-26T14:39:19+03:00', 'title': 'Microsoft Word - 2001.07495v5', 'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07495v5_Unsupervisedly_Learned_Representations:_Should_the', 'total_pages': 10, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}"

Does DPLL T correctly determine the satisfiability of formulas over arithmetic theories like LRA?,"CHAPTER 6. DPLL MODULO THEORIES 59
Example 6.D Consider this simple formula:
F ≜p ∧(q ∨p ∨¬r) ∧(p ∨¬q)
The ﬁrst thing DPLL will do is apply BCP , which will set the unit clause p to true.
The rest of the formula then simpliﬁes to true. This means that q and r are useless
variables—give them any interpretation and you’ll end up with a model, as long
as p is assigned true. Therefore, we call I = {p →true}a partial model of F.
Formally, eval(I(F)) =true. ■
6.3 DPLL Modulo Theories
We have seen how DPLL can decide satisﬁability of Boolean formulas. We now
present DPLL modulo theories, or DPLL T, an extension of DPLL that can handle for-
mulas over, for example, arithmetic theories like LRA . The key idea of DPLL T is to
start by treating a formula as if it is completely Boolean, and then incrementally
add more and more theory information until we can conclusively say that a for-
mula is SAT or UNSAT . We begin by deﬁning the notion of Boolean abstraction of
a formula.

What are the tradeoffs that multiobjective evolutionary algorithms can identify when balancing competing objectives?,"10
equal selection pressure [127].
A more principled solution to the existence of (or need
for) multiple ﬁtness functions is to use a multiobjective evolu-
tionary algorithm (MOEA) [22, 24, 33]. Such algorithms try
to satisfy all their given objectives (ﬁtness functions), and in
the cases where they partially conﬂict, map out the conﬂicts
between the objectives. This map can then be used to ﬁnd
the solutions that make the most appealing tradeoffs between
agents. These solutions, in which none of the objectives can be
improved without reducing the performance of one of the other
objectives, are said to be on the Pareto Front. Multiobjective
evolution has been used to balance between pure performance
and other objectives in several ways. For example, van Hoorn
et al. [136] used an MOEA to balance between driving well
and driving in a human-like manner (similar to recorded
playtraces of human drivers) in a racing game.
